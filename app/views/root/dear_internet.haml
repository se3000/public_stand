        Dear Internet,
      .letter-text
        %p We are tired of ineffective online petitions. We are tired of passion getting boiled down to number of emails collected. Nobody clicked their way to change. Why should we?
        %p Let’s help online advocacy grow up. Let’s use technology to make it cheaper, more accessible, and more meaningful. And let’s do it in a way that public officials can’t ignore.
        %p This is our mission at Public Stand. If you’re ready for change let us know, and we will let you know when we’re ready for action.
        %p
          With love,
          %br/
