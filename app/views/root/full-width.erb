      Dear Internet,
    </h1>
    <div class="letter-text">
      <p>We are tired of ineffective online petitions. We are tired of passion getting boiled down to number of emails collected. Nobody clicked their way to change. Why should we?</p>
      <p>Let’s help online advocacy grow up. Let’s use technology to make it cheaper, more accessible, and more meaningful. And let’s do it in a way that public officials can’t ignore.</p>
      <p>This is our mission at Public Stand. If you’re ready for change let us know, and we will let you know when we’re ready for action.</p>

      <p>With love,<br />
      Public Stand</p>
